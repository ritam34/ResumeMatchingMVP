SUMMARY
I have had the unique opportunity not only to be a team leader at ODA for a number of years, but also be mentored over the last two years by a colleague with over 20 years of leadership at ODA. Through observation and educational growth through course work, I was able to reflect on my own leadership style from the past and find areas of growth and expertise I can carry back into the role again. My strengths remain in finding the strengths within my team, growth in curriculum and leadership coursework, collaboration, promoting team growth and development, student centered and individual collaboration and problem-solving, and providing a balance between being a leader, a mentor, a nurturer, and colleague. I feel I would most benefit the 7th grade team with my organizational skills as well as creating a balance where individual teachers enhance the team by bringing their strengths to the team while guiding them through the growth process of teaming together. As a second female to the team with many years experience as a 7th grade team leader, I feel I bring an added perspective as well as years of ODA core values.

SUMMARY
I have had the unique opportunity not only to be a team leader at ODA for a number of years, but also be mentored over the last two years by a
colleague with over 20 years of leadership at ODA. Through observation and educational growth through course work, I was able to reflect on
my own leadership style from the past and find areas of growth and expertise I can carry back into the role again. My strengths remain in
finding the strengths within my team, growth in curriculum and leadership coursework, collaboration, promoting team growth and development,
student centered and individual collaboration and problem-solving, and providing a balance between being a leader, a mentor, a nurturer, and
colleague. I feel I would most benefit the 7th grade team with my organizational skills as well as creating a balance where individual teachers
enhance the team by bringing their strengths to the team while guiding them through the growth process of teaming together. As a second
female to the team with many years experience as a 7th grade team leader, I feel I bring an added perspective as well as years of ODA core
values.

I was thrilled to teach 5 Sociology classes my first semester at Bakersfield College. I improved student's critical thinking and writing abilities dramatically by having weekly and twice weekly writing assignments where I proofread for accuracy of concepts, critical thinking skills, sentence structure, punctuation, grammar, and citation. I would also challenge people to think about alternatives to what they wrote about. Another technique I used was having students rewrite papers to make them better. Students took their assignments more seriously. Writing improved. Critical thinking also improved.
Students also did a term paper on a particularly relevant social issue. I implemented regular tests and quizzes along with a pop quiz towards the end of the semester. The first quiz however, was designed as an assessment to see where the students needed help. This was a fabulous tool to help gauge what my students needed help in. This was when I discovered that many of my students needed help in their writing and expressive abilities.
I also focused on increasing student's capacity for memorization by having them develop and use flash cards. I also had them form and participate in study groups during class time. This was to show them that if they studied then their test scores would
improve...and indeed they did! I also required the students to practice their verbal skills by reading aloud excerpts from the book and the power point presentations, as well as their own material from different required assignments.
To emphasize working collaboratively (because many of today's work places have a high degree of collaboration) I had the students form into groups and do a research paper, a poster board, in class assignments and group presentations on various topics. My idea is to get the students to not only master concepts and to think critically, but to help them develop a proficiency and mastery of written communication, and oral communication. The improvements have been miraculous. I have taken students who can barely write, (I have a lot of English as a second, third, or fourth language learners) and not only worked with them but also found the resources that helped them improve in these critical areas. I had asked the writing and tutoring centers to present to my classes so that the students would become familiar with what those centers offered. I also had the students fill-out cards of times that they would go to those centers to get help.
Another technique that I used was to assign the A students with students getting lower grades. I did not tell them that this was what I was doing, as it seemed as if I was randomly assigning people into groups. I had asked each group to discuss how much time you spend studying, what your study habits are, and then to quiz each other on some of the material. I did this to let the lower grade students know that people who tend to get better grades take more time to do their work and to study.
For a student who showed mastery of the material, but were unable to do well on written tests because of test anxiety, I asked questions and would take their answers orally. A few other students were hospitalized or who where in the process of losing a family member and could not attend class. I did an online form of class with them.

Students also did a term paper on a particularly relevant social issue. I implemented regular tests and quizzes along with a pop quiz
towards the end of the semester. The first quiz however, was designed as an assessment to see where the students needed help. This
was a fabulous tool to help gauge what my students needed help in. This was when I discovered that many of my students needed
help in their writing and expressive abilities.
I also focused on increasing student's capacity for memorization by having them develop and use flash cards. I also had them form
and participate in study groups during class time. This was to show them that if they studied then their test scores would
improve...and indeed they did! I also required the students to practice their verbal skills by reading aloud excerpts from the book and
the power point presentations, as well as their own material from different required assignments.
To emphasize working collaboratively (because many of today's work places have a high degree of collaboration) I had the students
form into groups and do a research paper, a poster board, in class assignments and group presentations on various topics.
My idea is to get the students to not only master concepts and to think critically, but to help them develop a proficiency and mastery
of written communication, and oral communication. The improvements have been miraculous. I have taken students who can barely
write, (I have a lot of English as a second, third, or fourth language learners) and not only worked with them but also found the
resources that helped them improve in these critical areas. I had asked the writing and tutoring centers to present to my classes so
that the students would become familiar with what those centers offered. I also had the students fill-out cards of times that they
would go to those centers to get help.
Another technique that I used was to assign the A students with students getting lower grades. I did not tell them that this was what
I was doing, as it seemed as if I was randomly assigning people into groups. I had asked each group to discuss how much time you
spend studying, what your study habits are, and then to quiz each other on some of the material. I did this to let the lower grade
students know that people who tend to get better grades take more time to do their work and to study.
For a student who showed mastery of the material, but were unable to do well on written tests because of test anxiety, I asked
questions and would take their answers orally. A few other students were hospitalized or who where in the process of losing a family
member and could not attend class. I did an online form of class with them.

PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY
I have been retired from teaching for the last 8 years and have been involved in church work at the Harrisonville United Methodist Church. I have done volunteer work for Children's Mercy Hospital and hospice care.
I have 4 children, 6 grandchildren and 2 great-grandchildren. In the summers, I have had a Cousin Camp for my grandchildren and planned themed activities for them that they have loved. Activities were planned with a nod to education as well as fun.
I was known in my school district for doing things with my students that were a little out of the ordinary. For many years we collected money,usually through recycling efforts, bought a tree and planted it for Earth Day each year. One year we worked with the zoo to make decorated animal ceramic tiles that are still on display at the zoo. I instituted the Science Fair at Harrisonville Junior High, which I continued as the school changed from a Junior High to a Middle School until I retired. I have been involved in teaching all girl and all boy classes as well as teaching special education students and classes geared to ability level. While at Presentation School, I was involved in planning and carrying out church services with my students and planned and carried out a religious retreat with my 8th grade students. I believe in hands-on learning and feel that science in particular is best learned through activities. I have a great deal of varied experience that I would like to share with your students.

SUMMARY
I am a retired college teacher who has lived in Summit County for more than ten years. I taught at a community college, which means I had students with a variety of ethnic and cultural backgrounds, a wide range of academic ability and writing skills, and differing levels of curiosity and motivation. Teaching this group of students was challenging and required a variety of communication skills--an enthusiasm for the subject, a genuine rapport with students, and an ability to clearly explain the material being covered.
I have been active in the Summit county community. I was a member of the Summit County Library Board for five years, serving as its president for one of those years. I was also a member of the Library Foundation for seven years, working mainly to raise funds for a much larger library in Breckenridge. I have been a volunteer for a variety of public service groups, including the Keystone Adaptive Ski Program, the Colorado Fourteeners Initiative, and the Romp to Stomp out breast cancer.
HIGHLIGHTS
• I work well with people.
⚫ I have a friendly disposition.
⚫ I am eager and able to learn new things.
⚫ I have extensive writing/editing experience from my years of
teaching.
⚫ I am comfortable when engaged in public speaking.
ACCOMPLISHMENTS
I was a member of the Pi Sigma Alpha National Political Science Honor Society.
I taught more than 20,000 students over a thirty-year teaching career.
I was chairman of the History and Political Science Department at Mount San Antonio Community College.
I was a member of the college Faculty Senate.
I have worked with many children and adults with disabilities through the Keystone Adaptive Ski Program.
I received a ""Sheriff's Commendation"" for the rescue of a skier on Mount Quandary (article in SDN, December 28, 2009).
I was honored with the ""Peak Steward of the Year, 2011"" award from the Colorado Fourteeners Initiative.

Research Projects
American Sign Language Classification:
The project aimed to use SVM, CNN among other machine learning models to create an image classification system for ASL. The ASL dataset was first gathered, and the photos were then preprocessed using scaling, normalization, and data sampling. Models were then trained and tested using the preprocessed images as input, mainly PCA as a preprocessing technique. For model performance, we looked at the accuracy of each model against the execution time taken by each of them. According to the findings, the CNN model with two layers had an accuracy of 73.76%, while the SVM model with PCA had a maximum accuracy of 86.42%. In comparison to the other models, the SVM model with PCA also had the quickest execution time. The computational complexity of training and testing deep learning models on huge datasets was one of the main difficulties encountered, and hence we performed sampling.
Chest cancer classification
The project aimed at classifying chest X-ray images to detect the type of chest cancer. The images were preprocessed through augmentation and regularization. Models implied were CNN and ResNet50V2. Transfer learning was performed to increase the accuracy of model predictions.
Food Image Classification
Food recognition has become an important task in computer vision due to the increasing interest in developing intelligent systems for meal planning, calorie tracking, and dietary analysis ysis. Accurately identifying food items in images is crucial. for these applications. To address this, we proposed a ma- chine learning model that can precisely classify food items from the images. The dataset contains static images of food items with 11 classes, and each class has around 100 images. for the same food item. The models we aimed at was the clas- sic CNN model for image processing and also transfer learn- ing by the EfficientNet model. To improve the model's per- formance, we applied preprocessing techniques such as sam- pling, resizing, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature extraction. The EfficientNet model with preprocessed data performed best in terms of accuracy and computation cost. This efficient, model has the potential to aid proper nu- trition diet to users.
